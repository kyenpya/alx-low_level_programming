Task 0: Print List
Description
Writes a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.

Task 1: List Length
Description

Task 2: Add Node
Description
Writes a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.

Task 3: Add Node at the End
Description
Writes a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.

Task 4: Free List
Description
Writes a function that frees a listint_t list.

Task 5: Free List (Set Head to NULL)
Description
Writes a function that frees a listint_t list and sets the head to NULL.

Task 6: Pop
Description
Writes a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list and returns its data.

Task 7: Get Node at Index
Description
Writes a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

Task 8: Sum List
Description
Writes a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list

Task 9: Insert Node at Index
Description
Writes a function that inserts a new node at a given position in a listint_t linked list.
